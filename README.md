debian-mini-odroid-c1
=====================

Script to build a minimal Debian sd card image.  If you are looking for a minimal Debian image with read-only root file system, look [here](https://github.com/tomuta/debian-mini-ro-root-odroid-c1).

## Features:
* Debian Jessie
* Systemd
* SSH root login password: root
* DHCP on eth0
* Host name: odroidc1-MACADDRESS (e.g. odroidc1-1a2b3c4d5e6f)
* SSH host keys are generated and saved permanently on first boot
* Automatic mounting of USB storage devices using usbmount
* Some FS/Memory settings are applied on boot
* ZRAM modular and available (/etc/init.d/zram start)
* Additional packages: ca-certificates,ssh,vim-nox,htop,iotop,vnstat,locales,usbmount,initramfs-tools,ntpdate,tmux,sudo,bash-completion
* Rootfs default size: 2GB

You can customize the build editing common.mk.

## Prerequisites:
On a Ubuntu system, make sure the following packages are installed:
> sudo apt-get install build-essential wget git lzop u-boot-tools binfmt-support qemu qemu-user-static debootstrap parted

If you are running 64 bit Ubuntu, you might need to run the following commands to be able to launch the 32 bit toolchain:
> sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
> sudo apt-get update
> sudo apt-get install libc6:i386 libncurses5:i386 libstdc++6:i386 lib32z1

## Build the image:
Just use the make utility to build an sdcard.img.  Be sure to run this with sudo, as root privileges are required to mount the image.

> sudo make

This will install the toolchains, compile u-boot, the kernel, bootstrap Debian and create a 512mb sdcard.img file, which then can be transferred to a sd card (e.g. using dd):

> sudo dd bs=1M if=sdcard.img of=/dev/YOUR_SD_CARD
